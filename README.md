# Employee-Payroll-System

This repo is created for project employee payroll system

I have established connection between GUI and Database using Java Swing and MySQL
This repo will open a UI which has limited set of data coming from the database
I have not created much datasets to print in UI
Use src folder as your main directory in you local IDE 

**What needs to implemented further :
1.Salary Calculation:**
Define and implement predefined rules for salary calculation. Consider factors like base salary, overtime pay, deductions, bonuses, and taxes. Take into account any specific requirements or policies provided in the project description.

**2.Payroll Processing:**
Develop a module to process the payroll based on the defined salary calculation rules. Calculate salaries for each employee, considering factors like working hours, overtime, and any other applicable parameters. Generate pay stubs or reports for each employee, showcasing detailed salary information.

**3.File Input/Output:**
Allow users to import and export employee data from/to files. Implement functionality to read employee data from a file (e.g., CSV or Excel) and populate the system. Provide options to export payroll reports or employee data in various formats (e.g., PDF, CSV, Excel).

**4.Error Handling and Validation:**
Incorporate proper error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions and errors gracefully. Validate user input to ensure the data entered is accurate and complete. Implement appropriate error messages or notifications to guide the user in case of input errors.

**5.Testing and Debugging:**
Conduct thorough testing of the system to ensure its correctness and reliability. Perform unit testing on individual components and modules. Debug any issues or unexpected behavior encountered during testing.

**6.Documentation:**
Create detailed documentation explaining the system's architecture, modules, and functionality. Include instructions on how to run the program and use the various features. Document the design decisions and any assumptions made during development.

**7.User Guide:**
Develop a user guide or manual to assist users in navigating and using the payroll system. Provide clear instructions on how to input employee data, process payroll, and generate reports. Include any additional information or tips that can help users effectively utilize the system.
